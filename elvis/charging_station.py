"""Representation of a charging station of the infrastructure.

A charging station is the point of coupling between charging point (connection to the car)
and the grid. In LV grids the charging station immediately connects to the grid in MV grids a
transformer is needed in between.
- The charging station may consist of multiple charging points.
TODO:
    - It may be automated: After a car is charged it automatically connects itself to another car if
    available.
    - It may be inductive: No physical connection between car and charging point is needed:
    lower efficiency.
- Or manual: User have to connect and disconnect their vehicle by hand: Longer phases of inactivity.
TODO:
    - It can be operated with direct current or alternating current where different efficiencies
    have to be considered.
    - Its power is the sum over the power of its charging points.
    - It is limited by its power limits where the lower limit has to be understood as at least the
    lower limit or zero.
