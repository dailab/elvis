## Usage

Following, a simple example using one of the pre-defined scenario configurations
```python
from elvis import ScenarioConfig, simulate, num_time_steps

import yaml
with open("elvis/data/config_builder/office.yaml", 'r') as f:
    yaml_str = yaml.safe_load(f)
config_from_yaml = ScenarioConfig.from_yaml(yaml_str)

results = simulate(config_from_yaml, start_date='2020-01-01 00:00:00', end_date='2020-12-31 23:00:00', resolution='01:00:00')
load_profile = results.aggregate_load_profile(num_time_steps('2020-01-01 00:00:00', '2020-12-31 23:00:00', '01:00:00'))

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(load_profile)
```
